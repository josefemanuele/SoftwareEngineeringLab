\section{Introduction}
Prenotalo is a simple but comprehensive booking system. The idea at its core is
to have an accessible system to manage bookings and related operations.

\section{Objectives}
The aim of this project is to create a distributed system, made up of different
micro-services, that primarily provides booking management functionalities
as well as integration with additional services. 

The objectives of this project can be broken down into the following bullet points.
\begin{itemize}
\item a booking system
\item a user's registry
\item a payment integration
\item a notification integration
\item a survey collector
\item an analytics engine
\item a web interface
\item a mobile interface
\end{itemize}

\section{Functionalites}
The main functionalities of the system will be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide a way to register user data.
    \item Provide a way for a user to create new events.
    \item Provide a way for a user to look for available events.
    \item Provide a way for a user to book an event.
    \item Provide a way for a user to look for booked events.
    \item Provide a way for a user to cancel a booking.
    \item Provide a way for a user to cancel events.
    \item Provide a way for a user to pay for an attended event.
    \item Send users notifications about booked events, e.g. reminders.
    \item Provide a way for a user to create notifications about an event, e.g. broadcast messages.
    \item Collect surveys about completed events.
    \item Provide analytics about the data generated by the system.
    \item Provide a web application interface to use the system.
    \item Provide a mobile application interface to use the system.
\end{itemize}

Clients can use the system to search for available appointments or reservations at a specific time and date. Once they find an available slot, clients can book it by providing their contact information and any other necessary details. Clients can cancel or reschedule their appointments or reservations before they occur. Clients can view their past and upcoming bookings, and they can also manage their booking preferences. Clients can receive reminders about their upcoming appointments or reservations. In addition to these features, clients can pay for their appointments or reservations directly through the system. The system is made easy to use thanks to GUIs both for desktop and mobile devices.

\section{Potential users}
% Good. Satisfies 3
Such a system could potentially be used by any small business, merchant or
self-employed practitioner. This booking system aims to be general enough to be
useful any time there is a service offered in slots of time. Hence, some 
examples of potential users might be lawyers, doctors, hair salons, schools like driving schools, dancing schools, etc. On the other hand, clients of such businesses might use the system to book the offered services.

\section{Sample use cases}
% I would rewrite this section, it should be way more descriptive IMO.
% It should include someone that books something, someone that offers a
% service, and so on... Check what i have written after the original text
To have in mind some actual use cases, you might think of lawyer offering
hers/his services by appointment, providing a web interface to hers/his
clients, in order to perform bookings, as well as a mobile application to
manage reservations. Moreover, you can think of a driving school offering such
service to book driving lessons, let the clients pay through the system, or
sign their presence to the teaching classes, etc. Finally, any self-employed
practitioner could use the system to manage hers/his time slots, see analytics
about its most requested service, time frame, automatically collect surveys,
and communicate with hers/his clients through the notification integration.

% I would prefer to see something more like this
%% For example, imagine a doctor that can visit it's patients only during odd
%% days. Then he would register himself on the platform and insert his time 
%% availabilities in the system, eventually adding the cost of a visit and it's
%% duration.

%% Then their patients can search the doctor on the platform and choose a time
%% slot for a visit, eventually paying the amount for the visit.

%% Another example is the case of a barber. A barber can have different barbershops. Barbers can offer different services, for example hair cut, beard cut, etc. A Client needs to pick the barbershop, the service. Then, he finds a time slot for the service, book it. Then, he can receive the reminder of the appointment.

% We shoud add a scenario for each core functionality:
% * When the notification system is used?
% * When the analytics are used? And so on
% Actually every scenario is briefly explained in the first paragraph of this section. It also provides a use case for every functionality of the system: "analytics about the most requested service", "communicate with clients through the notification system".
