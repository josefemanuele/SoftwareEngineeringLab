% Required contents:
% 1. Objectives of the project
% 2. What the system should do
% 3. What are the potential users
% 4. Most important use cases

% Temporary introduction, needs more work.
In this document, we provide the initial idea and high-level specification of the project describing what are its objectives, what the system should do, what are the potential users and the more important use cases. The project deals with the development of a distributed system, made up of different micro-services, to manage bookings and related operations. Prenotalo is at its core a simple but comprehensive booking system.
\begin{table}[!h]

\begin{tabular}{l l}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Project Glossary}} \\
\hline
\textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition} \\
\hline
Consumer & Someone that requests or books a service offered by a Producer \\
\hline
Producer & Someone that provides services to Consumers \\
\hline
User & Platform user, so both Consumer and Producer \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

% Maybe extend additional services and utilities.
\begin{comment}
The aim of this project is to create a distributed system, made up of different
micro-services, that primarily provides booking management functionalities
and also integrating additional services and utilities.
\end{comment}

\section{Objectives}
% Maybe extend this section.
With objectives of the project we mean what the system aims to facilitate or solve. The system, Prenotalo, provides booking management functionalities also integrating additional services and utilities, like notification and analytics.

It facilitates interaction between consumers and producers. It aims to provide a simple and straightforward way for consumers to find, book, and manage their appointments or reservations. It helps producers manage their resources effectively.

\section{Functionalities}
For functionalities, we mean what the application should do in order to satisfy concretely the objectives. The main functionalities of the system will be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide a way to register user data.
    % Does it work like a concert (so there is an event and you buy a ticker for the event) or like a doctor office (so there is the doctor and you request an appointment).
    % An event is like a service (time slots, hair cut,...)
    \item Provide a way for a producer to create new events.
    \item Provide a way for a consumer to look for available events.
    \item Provide a way for a consumer to book an event.
    \item Provide a way for a consumer to look for booked events.
    \item Provide a way for a consumer to cancel a booking.
    \item Provide a way for a producer to cancel events.
    \item Provide a way for a consumer to pay for an attended event.
    \item Send consumers notifications about booked events, e.g. reminders.
    \item Provide a way for a producer to create notifications about an event, e.g. broadcast messages.
    \item Collect surveys about completed events.
    \item Provide data analytics obtained by the system to producer.
    \item Provide a web application interface to use the system.
    \item Provide a mobile application interface to use the system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Potential users}
% Good. Satisfies 3
Such a system could potentially be used by any small business, merchant or
self-employed practitioner. This booking system aims to be general enough to be
useful any time there is a service offered in slots of time. Hence, some 
examples of potential users might be lawyers, doctors, hair salons, schools like driving schools, dancing schools, etc. On the other hand, clients of such businesses might use the system to book the offered services.

\section{Sample use cases}
% I would rewrite this section, it should be way more descriptive IMO.
% It should include someone that books something, someone that offers a
% service, and so on... Check what i have written after the original text
To have in mind some actual use cases, you might think of lawyer offering
hers/his services by appointment, providing a web interface to hers/his
clients, in order to perform bookings, as well as a mobile application to
manage reservations. Moreover, you can think of a driving school offering such
service to book driving lessons, let the clients pay through the system, or
sign their presence to the teaching classes, etc. Finally, any self-employed
practitioner could use the system to manage hers/his time slots, see analytics
about its most requested service, time frame, automatically collect surveys,
and communicate with hers/his clients through the notification integration.

Sample use cases of the system are the following:
