A product backlog is a list of features or tasks that need to be done to deliver a valuable product to the customer. It is prioritized by the product owner based on the business value, user needs, and technical feasibility of each feature.

Here is a possible product backlog for your system, using the MoSCoW method to prioritize the features:
\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Priority} \\
\hline
User registration & Provide a way to register user data, such as name, email, password, role (consumer or producer), and preferences. & Must have \\
\hline
User authentication & Provide a way to verify the identity of the user and grant access to the system. & Must have \\
\hline
User profile & Provide a way to view and edit the user data and preferences. & Must have \\
\hline
Service declaration & Provide a way for a producer to declare offered services, such as name, description, duration, price, and availability. & Must have \\
\hline
Service browsing & Provide a way for a consumer to look for available services, using filters, categories, and keywords. & Must have \\
\hline
Event creation & Provide a way for a producer to create new events, either public or private, based on the offered services and the availability. & Must have \\
\hline
Event booking & Provide a way for a consumer to book an event, either public or private, based on the available services and the time slots. & Must have \\
\hline
Event cancellation & Provide a way for a producer or a consumer to cancel an event or a booking, with a notification to the other party. & Must have \\
\hline
Event payment & Provide a way for a consumer to pay for an attended event, using a secure payment method. & Must have \\
\hline
Event notification & Provide a way to send consumers notifications about booked events, such as reminders, confirmations, or cancellations. & Should have \\
\hline
Event message & Provide a way for a producer to create notifications about an event, such as broadcast messages, updates, or feedback requests. & Should have \\
\hline
Event survey & Provide a way to collect surveys about completed events, such as ratings, reviews, or suggestions. & Should have \\
\hline
Data analytics & Provide a way to provide data analytics obtained by the system to producers, such as number of bookings, revenue, customer satisfaction, or trends. & Could have \\
\hline

\hline
Mobile interface & Provide a mobile application interface to use the system, using a native or hybrid approach. & Could have \\

Here is a possible sprint plan for your system, using the Scrum framework and assuming a team of 5 people and a sprint length of 4 weeks:
\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{5cm}|p{7cm}|p{2cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Sprint} & \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Features}& \textbf{Estimated effort} \\
\hline
1 & To enable users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles. & User registration, User authentication, User profile, Web interface (for these features) & 80 hours \\
\hline
2 & To enable producers to declare and create events, and consumers to browse and book events. & Service declaration, Service browsing, Event creation, Event booking, Web interface (for these features) & 120 hours \\
\hline
3 & To enable users to cancel, pay, and receive notifications for events. & Event cancellation, Event payment, Event notification, Event message, Web interface (for these features) & 100 hours \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}\\
More in detail, here is a possible example of the product backlog divided into 3 sprints:
\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-0.3cm}
	\item Sprint 1: The goals of this sprint is to enable users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles. The product backlog items for this sprint are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\vspace{-0.3cm}
			\item As a user, I want to register into the system using name, email, password, role (consumer or producer), and preferences, so that I can access the system easily and securely.
			\vspace{-0.2cm}
			\item As a user, I want to authenticate into the system, so that I have access to the system.
			\vspace{-0.6cm}
			\item As a user, I want to view and edit the user data and preferences, so that I can update my personal information.
			\vspace{-0.2cm}
			\item As a user, I want to see a modern and responsive web design, so that I can use the system on any device and browser.
		\end{itemize}
	\vspace{-0.3cm}
	\item Sprint 2: The goals of this sprint is to enable producers to declare and create events, and consumers to browse and book events. The product backlog items for this sprint are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\vspace{-0.3cm}
			\item As a producer, I want to declare offered services, so that I satisfy customers by providing them with valuable solutions that meet their needs and preferences.
			\vspace{-0.2cm}
			\item As a consumer, I want to look for available services, using filters, categories, and keywords, so that I can find and book the best solution that meets my needs and preferences.
			\vspace{-0.2cm}
			\item As a producer, I want to create new events, either public or private, based on the offered services and the availability, so that I can generate more revenue and customer loyalty by offering diverse and customized solutions that cater to different needs and preferences.
			\item As a consumer, I want to book an event, either public or private, based on the available services and the time slots, so that I can secure my spot and enjoy the benefits of the service I'm interested in.
		\end{itemize}
	\vspace{-0.3cm}
	\item Sprint 3: The goals of this sprint is to enable users to cancel, pay, and receive notifications for users. The product backlog items for this sprint are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\vspace{-0.3cm}
			\item As a producer or a consumer, I want to cancel an event or a booking, with a notification to the other party, so that I can reschedule or reorganize the event or booking, due to changes in availability, demand, or preferences.
			\vspace{-0.2cm}
			\item As a consumer, I want to pay for an attended event, using a secure payment method, so that I can pay easily and securely.
			\vspace{-0.2cm}
			\item As a producer, I want to send consumers notifications about booked events, such as reminders, confirmation, or cancellations, so that I can enhance customer satisfaction by providing timely and relevant information that helps them prepare for and enjoy the event.
			\item As a producer, I want to create notifications about an event, such as broadcast messages, updates, or feedback requests, so that I can increase customer engagement by providing them with valuable and relevant information that enhances their event experience.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The specific product backlog items that the Scrum team will work on in the next sprint are agreed to at spring planning, which ocurs at the beginning of each sprint. During this activity, the team generates a spring backlog: a description of the task-level work that has to be completed to get the product backlog items done (see Figure \ref{fig:01}).
\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Each sprint has a sprint backlog}
\label{fig:01}
\end{figure}\\
A sprint backlog is a list of tasks that the team commits to complete in a sprint. Each task is derived from a feature or user story in the sprint plan, and has a clear definition of done, an owner, and an estimated effort. The team updates the sprint backlog daily to track the progress and status of each task.

Here is a possible sprint backlog for each sprint, based on the features and estimated effort in the sprint plan:
